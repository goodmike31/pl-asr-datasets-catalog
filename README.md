Polish ASR speech data survey and catalog.

# Survey goals
- Organization of publicly available information about Polish ASR speech datasets into the catalog.
- Providing ASR community with the collectively maintained, up-to-date source of information about available datasets.
- Identification of ASR speech datasets for Polish, which are freely available for reseach and commercial purposes.
<br>

# Survey results
- **Fifty-one datasets** intended for Polish ASR development were identified
- The **total** **size** of **documented Polish ASR speech data** amounts to over **26400** **hours** of **audio** and nearly **5300** **hours** of **transcribed** speech.
- **One thousand hours** worth speech data is **available** in a public domain
- Over **3100 hours** of speech data available through commercial providers. See [Public domain PL ASR speech datasets]
- Each dataset is described with up to 57 attributes. See [Taxonomy](https://github.com/goodmike31/pl-asr-speech-data-survey#taxonomy) for details.

# How to contribute to the Polish ASR speech datasets catalog 

# How to identify public domain PL ASR speech datasets
1. Open [Catalog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/181EDfwZNtHgHFOMaKNtgKssrYDX4tXTJ9POMzBsCRlI/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Filter results by column "Usage cost" by allowing only "free" values

# Addendum - Survey design  

## Dataset charateristics analysis process
- Publicly available Infomration sources were analyzed, annotated and standardized according to the Taxonomy
- Additionaly, the content of publicly available datasets was analyzed automatically

## Taxonomy
- The dataset cards taxonomy consists of 57 attributes.
- Each dataset is described ain terms of:
  - authorship, creation date, funding etc.
  - availability, licensing, pricing etc.
  - content e.g. audio format, number of speakers recorded, meta-data distributions, etc.
- Values of attributes not reported by dataset authors, publishers or researchers is recreated, when feasible (e.g. number of recordings)
- Full taxonomy is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/181EDfwZNtHgHFOMaKNtgKssrYDX4tXTJ9POMzBsCRlI/edit?usp=sharing).
